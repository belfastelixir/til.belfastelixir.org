# Today I Learned 

![TIL](assets/images/what_did_you_learn_today.png "TIL")

## Description

Following from [hashrocket](http://til.hashrocket.com) we thought it would be good to do the same for [belfast elixir](http://www.belfastelixir.org).

## Contribution

### Does it have to be about Elixir?

No, not really. It can be workflow related (like a short cut in vim or vscode) or it can be about TDD or DDD. However it wouldn't make much sense to have an article on Django here (unless they tie in with Elixir somehow). So you know, use your common sense :)

### How do I contribue

#### Fork it!

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo.

#### Ask us!

If we know you ask [holsee](https://www.github.com/holsee) or [swm](https://www.github.com/swmcc) to be added as a contributor. Create a branch then put up a PR. 

Any questions about contribution can be answered in the `#beam` room in the [Irish Tech Community](http://irishtechcommunity.com/)
